## Hosting HQ Website (Open-Sourced)
The Hosting HQ website is open sourced to provide a basis for developers who may be new to using express to understand how to use Express routing and file rendering.

## System Requirements
- Node.js v13 or Higher
- A NGINX or Apache Webserver (If being used with Hosting HQ, we do this step for you)

## To Run
You must install all dependencies in the package.json file (`npm i`)
Once installed, modify the ports for each server file (or just the server.js file if only using 1 language type)
Run `npm start` or `node start.js` on your console to start all of the language servers.

## Assistance
If you need assistance with the code, feel free to open an issue on this github.
